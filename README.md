# Parvus - Python Mini Project for Text Summarization
Parvus is a mini Python project developed by Reuben Chagas Fernandes that utilizes the Tkinter GUI toolkit and Hugging Face library models such as Facebook/BART-large-CNN. The main objective of Parvus is to summarize text.

To achieve this, Parvus employs advanced natural language processing techniques using the BART model to summarize a given text into a concise and informative summary. The summarization process is done by extracting the most important sentences or phrases from the input text.

Parvus's user interface is built using Tkinter, providing an easy-to-use interface for the user to input the text to be summarized and view the resulting summary. The summary is generated and displayed in real-time, making the process fast and efficient.

To run Parvus, you need to have the Transformers library installed. You can install it by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```pip install transformers```

This command will download and install the Transformers library along with its dependencies. Make sure you have a working Python installation and pip installed before running the command.
